      <p>I&rsquo;ve been using FUTO keyboard since three days ago, I wanted to write about it since day one to consider it as a real first impressions, but I had no time for it.</p>
<p>Anyway, there are things I like and I don&rsquo;t, but in general I could say it is good enough to consider using it as my daily keyboard for more days.</p>
<h2 id="what-i-like">
  What I like
  <a href="#what-i-like" class="h-anchor" aria-hidden="true">#</a>
</h2>
<p>Let me start with what I like. It&rsquo;s an open source project with a focus on privacy, and only for that I truly believe it&rsquo;s worth to try it.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know you, but I&rsquo;ve started to worry about my privacy online recently. I can&rsquo;t believe how much data I give to Google and other companies just for the convenience they provide, but it&rsquo;s something I don&rsquo;t want to continue doing.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m trying out Nextcloud as a replacement for Google Drive, Immich for Google Photos, CoMaps for Google Maps, and some fossify apps such as gallery, calendar and voice recorder for the Android ones. Now, I&rsquo;m trying to make FUTO keyboard my main keyboard, it&rsquo;s part of my journey on moving away from big tech services, not because they are bad, but because I don&rsquo;t trust them.</p>
<p>Being an open source project it&rsquo;s another advantage, as you can be sure it does what it says it does. For example, it&rsquo;s private and you can be sure of it.</p>
<p>But privacy is not everything I care right now. I&rsquo;m a developer and I&rsquo;m planning to contribute to the project on something I don&rsquo;t like about it, the padding on the numbers. You could agree with me that the padding Gboard has is better.</p>

  <div style="padding: 15px">
    <a >
      <img src="https://drive.google.com/thumbnail?id=1W13g19d_DKhlAlBRJmHOmtgetys1MXdf&amp;sz=w2270-h1230"  alt="FUTO vs Gboard numbers padding"  class="center" style="width: auto; border-radius: 10px;" />
    </a>
    
  </div>


<p>If you&rsquo;re not a developer and you find something you think can be improved, you can always talk to the developers or ask directly for a feature by opening an issue on its <a href="https://github.com/futo-org/android-keyboard/">GitHub repository</a>, trust me, it&rsquo;s not difficult.</p>
<p>The predictive text is also good, not as good as the Gboard one in my opinion, but it&rsquo;s good enough for me.</p>
<p>However, there&rsquo;s a feature it&rsquo;s missing on Gboard that is now fundamental for me, the navigation arrows. I use Obsidian to write a lot of different things, from my to-do list to the posts for my blog (just like this one), and I need the vertical navigation keys to navigate through a couple of plugins I use, that I previously was able to do only on my desktop.</p>

    </a>
    
  </div>


<p>About voice recording, this is the first time I use it, so I think it&rsquo;s okay. However, I type on English and Spanish daily and I haven&rsquo;t test it on Spanish yet. But English is working fine.</p>
<p>The last paragraph was using the voice recording feature, it&rsquo;s something I don&rsquo;t use often,  but I liked the result.</p>
<p>The built-in clipboard manager is also great. I never used this feature on Gboard, so I can&rsquo;t say how good or bad it is compared to it, but I can say it works fine and I think it&rsquo;s something I&rsquo;ll start using more frequently.</p>

  What I don&rsquo;t like
  <a href="#what-i-dont-like" class="h-anchor" aria-hidden="true">#</a>
</h2>
<p>I said predictive text is good, but at the same time it&rsquo;s the feature I believe is causing more friction on my transition from Gboard. Maybe I just need to use it more time to be comfortable with it, but I have to be honest with you, this feature it&rsquo;s really better on Gboard.</p>
<p>Another thing I didn&rsquo;t like was the default size, I had to shrink it on the settings to match a similar size to the one I have on Gboard,  but to be honest I don&rsquo;t remember if I also modified it on Gboard. It&rsquo;s something I didn&rsquo;t like, but it could be consider good as you can customize it to your needs.</p>
<p>I already mentioned the padding on the numbers on the top row, it&rsquo;s definitely something that doesn&rsquo;t look good in my opinion. And if you enable the dedicated row for the numbers, well, I don&rsquo;t like they don&rsquo;t have the same appearance as the rest of the keyboard.</p>

  <div style="padding: 15px">

    </a>
    
  </div>


<p>If you type on Spanish just like me, you could also find that the <code>¿</code> mark is not ergonomic to use. But again, as it&rsquo;s an open source project and I hope I can try to propose a change for it.</p>
<h2 id="conclusion">
  Conclusion
  <a href="#conclusion" class="h-anchor" aria-hidden="true">#</a>
</h2>
<p>If you&rsquo;re doing a transition from big tech software to open source alternatives, I think FUTO keyboard is a good option. I find it stable enough even if they consider it in alpha state, so I&rsquo;ll continue using it as my daily keyboard and I invite you to try it out.</p>
