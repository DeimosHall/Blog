I didn&rsquo;t use the HDD for much time, in fact it has damaged sectors, but fortunately I didn&rsquo;t loose any data. The funniest part is I should have suspected of it since the beginning, because I was unable to format it using EXT4 neither on my desktop or laptop. To deal with that issue, I had to format it using BTRFS, it worked, yeah, but now I think the reason of why I wasn&rsquo;t able to format it using EXT4 could be because of the damaged sectors, but I didn&rsquo;t know it in that moment. Maybe it was damaged on shipping, who knows?

      <p>I started my self hosting journey a while ago using an old laptop with Debian 12. It was fine with the internal SSD for a while, but I rapidly had to buy more storage, and I chose a 4 TB external HDD for that purpose.</p>
<p>I didn&rsquo;t use the HDD for much time, in fact it has damaged sectors, but fortunately I didn&rsquo;t loose any data. The funniest part is I should have suspected of it since the beginning, because I was unable to format it using EXT4 neither on my desktop or laptop. To deal with that issue, I had to format it using BTRFS, it worked, yeah, but now I think the reason of why I wasn&rsquo;t able to format it using EXT4 could be because of the damaged sectors, but I didn&rsquo;t know it in that moment. Maybe it was damaged on shipping, who knows?</p>
<p>I decided to choose and HDD because of the price and the longer lifetime compared to SSDs. Both reason are true in theory, but in practice I&rsquo;ve had SSDs with more lifetime than HDDs since I started using computers in my childhood. In fact, I&rsquo;m using an old Dell Latitude E7250 as my home server, it&rsquo;s a 10 year old laptop and its SSD is working pretty fine. So, that fact my SSDs have last for more time than my HDDs become them in a cheaper option.</p>
<p>In my days at colleague, I used to carry a portable HDD. Surprisingly, it worked for a couple of years with no issues, and I&rsquo;m really surprised because I carried it on my backpack carelessly. But one day I noticed it started to load my files very slow, I&rsquo;m not sure what I researched about, but I ended in the conclusion it could has damaged sectors, so I transfered as much of my data as possible.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t remember if I lose data, but I&rsquo;m sure I was scared of that possibility. Years later, I decided to buy an HDD for my new home lab hobby, bad idea. As I mentioned, it has damaged sectors, and this time I&rsquo;m pretty sure of it. I&rsquo;m now a linux user, so I ran the <code>badblocks</code> command to verify the HDD state, and sadly I can&rsquo;t trust on it for any serious work because I found damaged sectors.</p>
<p>I bought an external SSD the same day I discovered that problem. It was more expensive, yes, but I can trust that it will work correctly no matter if I have to move it and it suffer minor physical damage.</p>
<p>My home lab experiments started with an HDD, now I have and SSD, for how long? I don&rsquo;t know, but I&rsquo;d bet that it will last for many years. I&rsquo;ll never buy an HDD again.</p>
