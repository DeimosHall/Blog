  content="I&rsquo;m not going to lie, procrastination is part of my work journey. I&rsquo;m not proud of it, of course, but I have to admit it if I want to improve.
I&rsquo;ve deleted some of my social media accounts in the last years, including Facebook and Instagram, but YouTube and Twitter are still very important (and very addictive) to me.
I work from home, so you can imagine that it&rsquo;s so easy for me to take my phone or open a tab on my browser and just do anything except work. And that&rsquo;s true so many times a day, and the consequence is I have to stay in front of the screen, working after my work hours, because I have to finish the work, of course.

      <p>I&rsquo;m not going to lie, procrastination is part of my work journey. I&rsquo;m not proud of it, of course, but I have to admit it if I want to improve.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve deleted some of my social media accounts in the last years, including Facebook and Instagram, but YouTube and Twitter are still very important (and very addictive) to me.</p>
<p>I work from home, so you can imagine that it&rsquo;s so easy for me to take my phone or open a tab on my browser and just do anything except work. And that&rsquo;s true so many times a day, and the consequence is I have to stay in front of the screen, working after my work hours, because I have to finish the work, of course.</p>
<p>Coding is also my hobby. I love developing side projects to make my life easier. But there are days where I feel exhausted, because of my work and the time spent watching YouTube videos or the overwhelming news on Twitter. It&rsquo;s too much for my mind, I end up without mental energy to pay at least a little attention to my hobbies.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve tried time blocker extensions to limit the time periods where I can use certain sites, but I think I&rsquo;ve been very restrictive with a limit of 15 minutes a day, it has led me to disable the extension so I can use those addictive sites.</p>
<p>No more, I changed the strategy to limit only by time period. This way I believe I will be strong enough to survive during my working hours without using those sites, at least until 17:00, which is the time I set to allow me access.</p>
<p>It has worked for a couple of days, but wish me luck. Let&rsquo;s see how this experiment ends.</p>
<p>By the way, I don&rsquo;t use my phone to watch YouTube nor Twitter for about a year. So yeah, I&rsquo;ve been improving over time.</p>
