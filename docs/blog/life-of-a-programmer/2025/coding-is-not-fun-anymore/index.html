      <p>It was yesterday when I finally decided to click the cancel button of my GitHub Copilot subscription. The reason? I feel I&rsquo;m getting more and more stupid coding with AI.</p>
<h2 id="whoami">

<p>I truly believe the context matters on the decisions we take, and my context is I&rsquo;m still a junior developer who feels growing the coding skills is harder in the AI age.</p>
<p>I started to work as a firmware engineer on 2023, already in the AI age. However, the AI models weren&rsquo;t capable enough to generate good quality firmware code, so I had to figure out a lot of things by myself. I learnt a lot and I&rsquo;m grateful for that.</p>
<p>My employer didn&rsquo;t provide me with AI tools, but since they were ok with its usage, I decided to get the GitHub Copilot subscription and it was worth it. I felt I was writing code as a mid developer, I applied better architectures and design patterns with the help of AI, and many more things that made me realize the code I used to write by hand wasn&rsquo;t readable, maintainable, neither scalable, let&rsquo;s say a complete mess.</p>
<h2 id="new-work-new-rules">
  New work, new rules
  <a href="#new-work-new-rules" class="h-anchor" aria-hidden="true">#</a>
</h2>
<p>Now I&rsquo;m working as a Java dev, and of course I use AI daily at my work, let&rsquo;s say it&rsquo;s &ldquo;mandatory&rdquo; and I have to do it. They say coding with AI is the future of the industry and I agree, or at least I agree with 80% of what they believe.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m completely fine with generating code with AI at my work because I&rsquo;m developing features I don&rsquo;t care for projects I don&rsquo;t care about, so the only hard task I still have to &ldquo;manually&rdquo; do is understanding the business logic and requirements to convert them into prompts to get the job done. And I&rsquo;m fine with that.</p>
<p>By the way, vibe coding isn&rsquo;t what I do if you&rsquo;re thinking on that. Maybe I&rsquo;ll talk about my AI workflow in a future post.</p>
<p>Although I said growing my coding skills is harder than before, I also have to admit that now I have more time and mental energy to develop other skills, such as managing AWS services and understanding the business logic.</p>
<p>Who knows, maybe the future of this industry is us talking (not writing) to our computers to write the code to do the features we have on mind.</p>
<h2 id="productivity--happiness">
  Productivity != happiness
  <a href="#productivity--happiness" class="h-anchor" aria-hidden="true">#</a>
</h2>
<p>I&rsquo;ve been reading the Rust book for a long time because I&rsquo;d like to use it for my side projects. One of them is a cli tool, that in fact I already have a Python version of it, but you know, I want to rewrite it in Rust.</p>
<p>The thing is I was impatient and I asked Gemini to do it for me, my thoughts at that moment were I could take that version and improve it by hand, just a shortcut, I said. But when I ran the code and it worked pretty fine, I just felt I wasn&rsquo;t doing the right thing. I was supposed to write that simple project because I wanted to learn Rust, but if I delegate most of the development to AI, what exactly am I going to learn?</p>
<p>Children still learn to do math by hand, even if we use calculators in real life, it&rsquo;s still important to know what&rsquo;s happening behind the scenes. I truly believe it&rsquo;s the same for coding, I need to know the language in a way I&rsquo;m confortable enough before using the today&rsquo;s programmers calculator, the AI.</p>
<p>So, even if I can build almost anything with AI, I have to limit its usage if I want to develop my coding skills, at least on my side projects. Its usage on my work won&rsquo;t change, the engineering level for the features I develop is not that high, I can focus on other aspects.</p>
<p>Without further ado, goodbye. Have a great day, and remember to be happy.</p>
