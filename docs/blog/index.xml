          &lt;p&gt;Hello, I&amp;rsquo;m Francisco Torres, a software developer from Mexico. I studied electronics engineering, it is not too related to software development, but I learned programming by myself. Yes, I saw some of C progamming in college, but it was not in a deep way and I didn&amp;rsquo;t have too many programming related subjects.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I was looking for an internship since 2022 winter. In that time I was almost in my last semester of the university, and I had the option to do an internship while I was studying the last semester. I sent my resume to some companies in Linkedin, but no one called me. It wasn&amp;rsquo;t something bad for me, because I was still studying and I had time to find a job.&lt;/p&gt;
