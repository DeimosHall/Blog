To be honest, I believed it would be something easy, but in the second week I realized I needed to spend more hours on it because I underestimate the complexity of the frontend. I don&rsquo;t know how to explain it, the frontend is full of technologies that does the same, one tool has an alternative and the alternative has multiple alternatives, it was a problem for me who is not in the frontend world. I also surprised how difficult is to create a simple global variable in React, we have to use something called Redux or React Conext to deal with this problem, I read they have some differences and there are probably more alternative out there. Anyway, I was able to find a solution for every issue I had and the frontend looks good in my opinion.

      <p>Oh well, I&rsquo;m writing this after more than three weeks, but I certainly delivered the project I mentioned <a href="/blog/who-cares/react_and_spring_boot_in_less_than_three_weeks/index/">in the part 1</a> on time.</p>
<p>To be honest, I believed it would be something easy, but in the second week I realized I needed to spend more hours on it because I underestimate the complexity of the frontend. I don&rsquo;t know how to explain it, the frontend is full of technologies that does the same, one tool has an alternative and the alternative has multiple alternatives, it was a problem for me who is not in the frontend world. I also surprised how difficult is to create a simple global variable in React, we have to use something called Redux or React Conext to deal with this problem, I read they have some differences and there are probably more alternative out there. Anyway, I was able to find a solution for every issue I had and the frontend looks good in my opinion.</p>
<p>About the backend, it&rsquo;s something completely different. It&rsquo;s easier to code, the architectures are easier to understand, the tests are easier to implement, I definitely enjoyed more coding the backend than the frontend. For example, once I understood how to work with models, controllers and services, I was able to add all the logic I needed by myself, I had to googled or ask to llms less than in the frontend. Some day in the future, I&rsquo;d like to be a backend dev.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s it, I was able to create a full stack application in less than a mouth with no experience in web development, well almost no experience because I already knew the basic concepts of HTML, CSS and JavaScript. I believe the phrase a lot of devs says it&rsquo;s true, &ldquo;technologies are easy to learn if you already know how to code&rdquo;.</p>
