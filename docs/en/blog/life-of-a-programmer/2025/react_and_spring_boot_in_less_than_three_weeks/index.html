  content="I&rsquo;ve been working as a firmware engineer for two years, but I don&rsquo;t make enough money to get the life style I wish, so I&rsquo;m here, in a big trouble where I have to learn web development for a project I have to deliver this month.
As I said I&rsquo;m a firmware engineer, the main programming languages I use everyday are C/C&#43;&#43; and sometimes Python. I learned to code with Java tutorials on YouTube on 2018, it gived me the basic concepts of how to write code, but I haven&rsquo;t used it since then. About the web side, well, I took some courses on YouTube and Udemy when I was in college because I thought it could be my entry point to the software industry, but I only learned some basic stuff again.

      <p>I&rsquo;ve been working as a firmware engineer for two years, but I don&rsquo;t make enough money to get the life style I wish, so I&rsquo;m here, in a big trouble where I have to learn web development for a project I have to deliver this month.</p>
<p>As I said I&rsquo;m a firmware engineer, the main programming languages I use everyday are C/C++ and sometimes Python. I learned to code with Java tutorials on YouTube on 2018, it gived me the basic concepts of how to write code, but I haven&rsquo;t used it since then. About the web side, well, I took some courses on YouTube and Udemy when I was in college because I thought it could be my entry point to the software industry, but I only learned some basic stuff again.</p>
<p>My problem now is I have to learn at least the basics of TypeScript and ReactJS for the fronted and Java, Maven and Spring Boot for the backend, those are the project requirements. I think I can check tutorials on YouTube to know how to get started and I&rsquo;m planning to use Github Copilot, Chat GPT and Gemini to speed up the development process, I&rsquo;m pretty sure I wouldn&rsquo;t be able to do the project without AI tools. And well, I&rsquo;ll return to write another article here when I deliver the project, wish me luck.</p>
