          &lt;p&gt;I stopped using Nextcloud a couple of days ago because I broke my home server, and I realized I don&amp;rsquo;t miss it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I find myself using more frequently the local data I have on my PC rather than the one on Nextcloud, the only useful case was for watching some anime chapters on my tablet, but even that could change in the future if I start using &lt;a href=&#34;https://jellyfin.org/&#34;&gt;Jellyfin&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When I tried to use some of the office integrations that Nextcloud offers, I failed. It was hard to figure out what should I do, I even ended watching tutorials for something I shouldn&amp;rsquo;t, I mean, I&amp;rsquo;m a technical person, but the UX is just not intuitive.&lt;/p&gt;

          &lt;p&gt;I started my self hosting journey a while ago using an old laptop with Debian 12. It was fine with the internal SSD for a while, but I rapidly had to buy more storage, and I chose a 4 TB external HDD for that purpose.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I didn&amp;rsquo;t use the HDD for much time, in fact it has damaged sectors, but fortunately I didn&amp;rsquo;t loose any data. The funniest part is I should have suspected of it since the beginning, because I was unable to format it using EXT4 neither on my desktop or laptop. To deal with that issue, I had to format it using BTRFS, it worked, yeah, but now I think the reason of why I wasn&amp;rsquo;t able to format it using EXT4 could be because of the damaged sectors, but I didn&amp;rsquo;t know it in that moment. Maybe it was damaged on shipping, who knows?&lt;/p&gt;

          &lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;ve been using FUTO keyboard since three days ago, I wanted to write about it since day one to consider it as a real first impressions, but I had no time for it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Anyway, there are things I like and I don&amp;rsquo;t, but in general I could say it is good enough to consider using it as my daily keyboard for more days.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;what-i-like&#34;&gt;
  What I like
  &lt;a href=&#34;#what-i-like&#34; class=&#34;h-anchor&#34; aria-hidden=&#34;true&#34;&gt;#&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Let me start with what I like. It&amp;rsquo;s an open source project with a focus on privacy, and only for that I truly believe it&amp;rsquo;s worth to try it.&lt;/p&gt;
