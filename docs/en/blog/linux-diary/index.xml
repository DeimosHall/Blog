          &lt;p&gt;I started my self hosting journey a while ago using an old laptop with Debian 12. It was fine with the internal SSD for a while, but I rapidly had to buy more storage, and I chose a 4 TB external HDD for that purpose.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I didn&amp;rsquo;t use the HDD for much time, in fact it has damaged sectors, but fortunately I didn&amp;rsquo;t loose any data. The funniest part is I should have suspected of it since the beginning, because I was unable to format it using EXT4 neither on my desktop or laptop. To deal with that issue, I had to format it using BTRFS, it worked, yeah, but now I think the reason of why I wasn&amp;rsquo;t able to format it using EXT4 could be because of the damaged sectors, but I didn&amp;rsquo;t know it in that moment. Maybe it was damaged on shipping, who knows?&lt;/p&gt;

          &lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;ve been using FUTO keyboard since three days ago, I wanted to write about it since day one to consider it as a real first impressions, but I had no time for it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Anyway, there are things I like and I don&amp;rsquo;t, but in general I could say it is good enough to consider using it as my daily keyboard for more days.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;what-i-like&#34;&gt;
  What I like
  &lt;a href=&#34;#what-i-like&#34; class=&#34;h-anchor&#34; aria-hidden=&#34;true&#34;&gt;#&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Let me start with what I like. It&amp;rsquo;s an open source project with a focus on privacy, and only for that I truly believe it&amp;rsquo;s worth to try it.&lt;/p&gt;
