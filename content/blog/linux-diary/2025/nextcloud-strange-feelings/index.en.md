I stopped using Nextcloud a couple of days ago because I broke my home server, and I realized I don't miss it.

I find myself using more frequently the local data I have on my PC rather than the one on Nextcloud, the only useful case was for watching some anime chapters on my tablet, but even that could change in the future if I start using [Jellyfin](https://jellyfin.org/).

When I tried to use some of the office integrations that Nextcloud offers, I failed. It was hard to figure out what should I do, I even ended watching tutorials for something I shouldn't, I mean, I'm a technical person, but the UX is just not intuitive.

Nextcloud offers a lot of tools, I remember I saw things such as a calendar, a kanban table, the office suite, tasks, and many others, but the most important thing (file management) doesn't work well. I can't understand why the mobile app doesn't allow two way syncing, I ignored it just because I rely on a third party app for Google Drive for that, but if I wanted to do a full migration, I couldn't.

The desktop experience is fine, the syncing tool worked with no issues, but the web interface has many broken UI elements that made me feel I was using an incomplete software. I'd like to show you some screenshots of what I mean, but I really don't want to install it again just for that reason.

Anyway, I'd bet if they'd focus more on the core app instead of having many applications, Nextcloud could be a good Google Drive alternative. For now, I started to explore other alternatives, and my next experiment will be with [Seafile](https://www.seafile.com/en/home/)
