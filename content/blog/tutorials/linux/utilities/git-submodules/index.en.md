Adding a submodule within a specific directory is as easy as navigating to that directory and running the following command:

```bash
git submodule add https://github.com/hextreeio/faultier.git
```

> If we wanted that submodule in the root of the project we would simply have to do it in the root.

If you wanted the name of the generated directory to be different than `faultier` which is the one that would be generated by the repository name itself, you would have to do it by adding as an option at the end

```bash
git submodule add https://github.com/hextreeio/faultier.git other_dir_name
```

## Submodule with submodules

If the submodule that we add has submodules as dependencies, what we have to do is the following:

1. Navigate inside the submodule, for the example:

```bash
cd faultier/
```

2. Register the submodules

```bash
git submodule init
```

3. Update the submodules

```bash
git submodule update
```

We would have something like the following:

```bash
❯ git submodule init
Submodule 'nanopb' (https://github.com/nanopb/nanopb.git) registered for path 'nanopb'.

faultier on main via C v16.0.0-clang via △ v3.30.3
❯ git submodule update
Cloning into '/Users/deimos/dev/embedded/electronic_cats/faultycat/firmware/c/faultier/nanopb'...
Submodule path 'nanopb': checked out 'e34dfae6f1aeb87cbe1c05a8fb96f5b9cb1034f6'
```
