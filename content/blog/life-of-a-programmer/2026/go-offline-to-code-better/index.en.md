I'm not going to lie, procrastination is part of my work journey. I'm not proud of it, of course, but I have to admit it if I want to improve.

I've deleted some of my social media accounts in the last years, including Facebook and Instagram, but YouTube and Twitter are still very important (and very addictive) to me.

I work from home, so you can imagine that it's so easy for me to take my phone or open a tab on my browser and just do anything except work. And that's true so many times a day, and the consequence is I have to stay in front of the screen, working after my work hours, because I have to finish the work, of course.

Coding is also my hobby. I love developing side projects to make my life easier. But there are days where I feel exhausted, because of my work and the time spent watching YouTube videos or the overwhelming news on Twitter. It's too much for my mind, I end up without mental energy to pay at least a little attention to my hobbies.

I've tried time blocker extensions to limit the time periods where I can use certain sites, but I think I've been very restrictive with a limit of 15 minutes a day, it has led me to disable the extension so I can use those addictive sites.

No more, I changed the strategy to limit only by time period. This way I believe I will be strong enough to survive during my working hours without using those sites, at least until 17:00, which is the time I set to allow me access.

It has worked for a couple of days, but wish me luck. Let's see how this experiment ends.

By the way, I don't use my phone to watch YouTube nor Twitter for about a year. So yeah, I've been improving over time.
