> Note: Script for a YouTube video.

Ladies and gentlemen, welcome to this experiment.

Having a YouTube channel is something I've wanted to do since a lot of years age, so here I am. You know, it's never too late to follow your dreams, and I definitely don't want to grow old without having tried.

What I intend to do with this channel is talk about two topics I like a lot, open source software and software development. It could change in the future, of course, but right now it is what I want.

I'm planning to start converting my current blog posts into videos, just in case you didn't know, my blog is `deimoshall.dev`. I'll be writing there first before I upload any video, so if you like reading you can check it out.

I'm de-googling my life as much as I can, so I'll also be uploading my videos to other platforms such as PeerTube and Odysee. You can follow me there if you want :).

This is just my starting point, a little step into the world of content creation. Wish me luck and see you next time!
