I've been working as a firmware engineer for two years, but I don't make enough money to get the life style I wish, so I'm here, in a big trouble where I have to learn web development for a project I have to deliver this month.

As I said I'm a firmware engineer, the main programming languages I use everyday are C/C++ and sometimes Python. I learned to code with Java tutorials on YouTube on 2018, it gived me the basic concepts of how to write code, but I haven't used it since then. About the web side, well, I took some courses on YouTube and Udemy when I was in college because I thought it could be my entry point to the software industry, but I only learned some basic stuff again.

My problem now is I have to learn at least the basics of TypeScript and ReactJS for the fronted and Java, Maven and Spring Boot for the backend, those are the project requirements. I think I can check tutorials on YouTube to know how to get started and I'm planning to use Github Copilot, Chat GPT and Gemini to speed up the development process, I'm pretty sure I wouldn't be able to do the project without AI tools. And well, I'll return to write another article here when I deliver the project, wish me luck.
