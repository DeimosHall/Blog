Hello friends! This is a practical course about VHDL. Don't expect boring theory, we're going to learn by making examples. I'm going to use the Cyclone II FPGA beacuse it's cheap and easy to get, but you can use the board you want because the VHDL language doesn't change.

## Installing Quartus II

Quartus II is the embedded systems design software we need to work with the Cyclone II FPGA. We can download it from the Intel's page by searching "Quartus II" or by clicking on [this link](https://www.intel.com/content/www/us/en/software-kit/711791/intel-quartus-ii-web-edition-design-software-version-13-0sp1-for-windows.html).

Make sure to select the 13.Osp1 version. Go to the downloads section and select "Individual Files".

The files we need to download are the ModelSimSetup, the QuartusSetupWeb and the package according to your board, in my case is the Cyclone II.

Once we have the files downloaded, we need to run QuartusSetupWeb as administrator.

We must click on next several times, accept the terms and conditions, select a directory to install the program, select all the components we want to install and continue clicking on next until the process is complete.

Once the installation has been completed, we can run the program and if a message asks you to get a subscription just click on Run the Quartus II Software.
